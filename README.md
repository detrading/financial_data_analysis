# Financial Data Analysis

This project explores correlation between trends in trader/investor online information gathering and subsequent stock price movements. This involves using third-party APIs and custom requests to retrieve current and historical stock price data from Yahoo Finance, calculating metrics for comparing stock performance over time (n-day trailing returns averaged over some time period, arbitraily large magnitude gains or losses). These data are compared with time series of internet serach term frequncy, from Google Trends, for search queries related financial performance of individual stocks or market benchmarks.  The project seeks to identify terms and temporal lags that show the highest correlations between the search term frequency data and stock prices.

It has been reported in multiple journal articles and white papers (authored or co-authored by Google employees and others, see literature review file for links) that an increase in financial-market-realted search terms can be associated with a subsequent stock sell off. This is related to concepts of risk aversion and information gathering in decision theory, where individuals may spent more time investigating sources of potential losses than potential gains (of equal size), and seek this information prior to making their trades. 

This project includes using API use, making custom web data requests, calculating derived indicators, statistical analysis, exploring cross-correlation between lagged time series, and tabulation and graphical display of results. Machine learning could also be relevant, but simple statistical correlation provides a sufficient first pass.
